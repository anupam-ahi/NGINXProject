# NGINXProject
NGINX Project by following the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8OleYuqntY

Things that I learnt from this project:
1. Understood what a web proxy is. How people use nginx as a web proxy. 
2. Also learnt how to use the docker file to run multiple instances of the same server across different ports
3. To use nginx conf file to route traffic to a more secured server port
4. To create an SSL certificate that can be used to send encrypted data from the client to server and vice versa. 
5. Also monitored the logs of nginx to see which server instance is being hit. 
6. to pass the necessary details of the client to the server instance. 
7. employed the least connection load algorithm in order to determine which instance of the server should the proxy route the client's request to.
